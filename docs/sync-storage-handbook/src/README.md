# Introduction

Application Services are a set of libraries for connecting Mozilla products to the Firefox ecosystem. As we make Firefox available on more platforms, and grow from Firefox with entirely new products, we've found some common needs: signing in to a Firefox Account, syncing data through Firefox Sync, and receiving push messages. Application Services offers integrations for these services, so that products don't have to write their own.

- Why is storage integrated with Sync?
- Should we talk about push and FxA elsewhere?
- Where does this handbook fit in with the story we want to tell about app services?

# Syncable store

The syncable store, part of the domain layer, is the heart of each component. It exposes high-level operations for each data type, like recording a history visit, adding a bookmark, changing a password, or syncing with the server. The store is written in safe, idiomatic Rust, and shared across platforms, so you only need to implement operations once.

The store lives in the `src` subdirectory of each component.

# Syncing

Syncing is tightly integrated into storage. This isn't an accidentâ€”we've found that pushing concerns like change tracking and conflict resolution down into the store is far less error-prone than managing them separately.

## Merging

Conflict resolution is an important part of syncing. Each store implements a strategy for reconciling local changes with changes from other devices.

Logins uses three-way merging to resolve sync conflicts, where changing different fields of the same record on both sides carries both changes forward. Places uses a two-way [tree merge](https://mozilla.github.io/dogear/) for bookmarks, and takes the complete record based on its timestamp.

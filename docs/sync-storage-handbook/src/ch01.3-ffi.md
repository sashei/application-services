# FFI

All components expose a C ABI-compatible [foreign function interface](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html) for platform-specific bindings. These functions are unsafe by necessity, as the FFI supports only a limited set of types. They also take care of managing calls from multiple threads, handing out safe references to Rust structures, and serializing and deserializing arguments using Protobufs.

The [ffi-support](https://docs.rs/ffi-support/0.1.3/ffi_support/) crate extracts some of the common patterns we've adopted for our FFIs.

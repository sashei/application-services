# Bindings

The binding layer is an ergonomic interface for the application that's consuming the component. It's written in Kotlin for Android, and Swift for iOS. These bindings live in `components/{component}/android` and `components/{component}/ios`, respectively. They're meant to be as thin as possible; the bulk of the implementation lives in shared Rust code.
